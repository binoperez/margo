							"I am a Managing Director in Accenture Digital, leading Digital Solution Design (DSD) in EALA. DSD defines the technologies, methods and architectures used in Accentureâ€™s interactive, analytics and mobile solutions, and encompasses Solution Architecture and Technology Architecture for Digital. For much of the past 15 years, I have specialised in the delivery of mobile applications. Working with organisations with large distributed workforces, I have helped Accentureâ€™s customers move from a world of custom middleware and device drivers, to a landscape of ubiquitous mobile apps, adoption of consumer devices, user-centric design, and now the internet-of-things. I am passionate about how technology can transform the way people and organisations work, and how techniques such as Agile can change the way we deliver software. I was originally trained as an aerospace engineer, making a brief foray into aerodynamics before embarking on a technology architecture career. During my time with Accenture I've worked in industries as diverse as financial services and professional football clubs, before finally specialising in mobility for utilities. I hold an MEng in Aeronautical Engineering, and am a Member of the Institution of Engineering Technology (MIET) and a Chartered Engineer."
